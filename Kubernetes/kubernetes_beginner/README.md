Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration system. At a high level, Kubernetes provides a platform to deploy, maintain, and scale containerized applications using a declarative approach. Here's a brief rundown of the main components and their working principles:

1. **Cluster**: At the highest level, a Kubernetes setup consists of a cluster, which is a set of nodes (VMs or physical servers) grouped together to run containerized applications.

2. **Master Nodes**:
    - **kube-apiserver**: Serves the Kubernetes API, which is used by other components and tools to communicate.
    - **etcd**: A consistent and highly-available key-value store used to store all cluster data.
    - **kube-controller-manager**: Runs controller processes. These controllers watch the state of the cluster and work towards the desired state (e.g., ensuring the right number of pod replicas).
    - **kube-scheduler**: Watches for newly created pods and assigns them to nodes based on resource requirements, constraints, and other factors.

3. **Worker Nodes**:
    - **kubelet**: An agent that runs on each node in the cluster and ensures the containers are running in a pod.
    - **kube-proxy**: Maintains network rules for pod communication. It enables the Kubernetes service abstraction by maintaining IP rules and doing load balancing.
    - **Container Runtime**: Software responsible for running containers, like Docker or containerd.

4. **Pods**: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They can contain one or more containers, share storage, and have a unique network IP.

5. **Services**: An abstraction for exposing pods as network services. It allows you to connect to pods using a stable IP address or DNS name, even if the pods themselves are ephemeral.

6. **ReplicaSets and Deployments**: 
    - **ReplicaSet**: Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
    - **Deployment**: Provides declarative updates for pods and ReplicaSets. It allows for easy scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks.

7. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Allow you to separate your configuration and sensitive data from application code, which is especially useful in a microservices environment.

8. **Volumes**: Provide persistent storage for your workload, allowing data to survive pod restarts. Examples include local storage, cloud providers' storage systems like AWS EBS, and network storage solutions like NFS.

9. **Ingress**: An API object that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP. It can provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.

10. **Namespaces**: Support multiple virtual clusters within the same physical cluster. Useful for separating different environments like development, testing, and production within the same cluster.

11. **StatefulSets**: For workloads that need stable hostnames, stable persistent storage, and ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.

12. **DaemonSets**: Ensure that all or some nodes run a copy of a pod, useful for node-level system services.

13. **Jobs and CronJobs**: 
    - **Job**: Creates one or more pods and ensures a specified number of them successfully terminate.
    - **CronJob**: Like Jobs, but allows you to run them on a scheduled basis.

14. **Controllers**: They regulate the state of the system. For example, if a node fails, the Replication Controller ensures that the designated number of pod replicas are maintained, by creating a new pod on another node if necessary.

15. **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: Extend the Kubernetes API by defining new resource types.

This is a high-level overview, and Kubernetes has many more components and features that can be added and configured based on the needs of the specific application and infrastructure.
